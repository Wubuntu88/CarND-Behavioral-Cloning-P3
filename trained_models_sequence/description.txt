Here is a description of the steps I took to train my model multiples times after the first big training.

I first trained with around 7 data runs, and came up with a model that did pretty well.
I chose to use that model and retrain it several times in sequence.  Each time I did the training, I would only show
it new data where it had previously had problems.

zTrainSeq01.h5 (trained on MyDatazTurnHardCorner01)
For this run, I trained on data where the car was turning the sharp right where the lake was in front.

zTrainSeq02.h5 (trained on MyDatazTurnHardCorner02)
Same training location as in zTrainSeq01.h5, but in a slightly different orientation.

zTrainSeq03.h5 (trained on MyDatazTurnHardCorner03)
Same training location as in zTrainSeq01.h5, with different orientation.
